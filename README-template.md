## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This is the first time I use an API, with this project I learned how to do so. I tought it was going to be something harder but nah, it is just like an external JSON.

### Continued development

I am interested in how i can use APIs in more advenced projects and their potential.
